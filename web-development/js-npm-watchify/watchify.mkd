# watchify

## Problem
We want to run `browserify` but restarting from command line is tedious

## Solution
Use `watchify` to basically do everything `browserify` does only with watching, i.e. automatically
restart when files are changed.

## demo
1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`
3. `open index.html`

Notice that it alerts **1,2,3,4**

Now update main.js and reload the page, notice the update.
